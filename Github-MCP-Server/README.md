# **Understand About MCP Server – Make Your GitHub Workflow Smooth and Easy**

## **What is an MCP Server?**

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is a standardized communication protocol designed to facilitate interactions between Large Language Model (LLM) applications and external services. It acts as a bridge, enabling LLMs to access and manage various tools and resources across different systems. This protocol ensures that LLMs can focus on their core functionality while delegating tasks to specialized servers.

### **Purpose:**

The primary purpose of an MCP server is to provide a standardized interface for LLMs to interact with external tools and services. This standardization simplifies the integration process, allowing developers to focus on building more complex applications without worrying about custom integrations.

## **Real-World Example or Comparison**

#### **Example:**  
Imagine a scenario where you're using a virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa to manage your smart home devices. Now, imagine this assistant can also interact with GitHub to manage repositories, issues, and pull requests. This is similar to what an MCP server does—but for LLMs and GitHub operations. Just as your virtual assistant simplifies controlling multiple devices, an MCP server simplifies interactions between LLMs and external services like GitHub.

#### **Comparison:**  
Another way to think about MCP servers is by comparing them to APIs. Just as APIs provide a standardized way for different applications to communicate, MCP servers provide a standardized way for LLMs to interact with external tools and services.


## **What is the GitHub MCP Server?**

The GitHub MCP Server is a specific implementation of the Model Context Protocol designed to interact with the GitHub API. It allows LLM agents to manage GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, branches, files, and releases through a standardized interface. This server enables LLM applications to leverage GitHub's features without needing custom integrations.

#### **Features:**

- **Repository Management:** Create, update, and manage GitHub repositories.  
- **Issue and Pull Request Management:** Create, update, and manage issues and pull requests.  
- **Branch Management:** Manage branches within repositories.  
- **File Management:** Access and manage files within repositories.  
- **Release Management:** Create and manage releases.


## **Why Do We Need the GitHub MCP Server?**

### **Benefits:**

- **Standardization:** MCP provides a standardized way for LLMs to interact with external tools, eliminating the need for custom integrations.  
- **Extensibility:** It allows LLM applications to focus on core functionality while delegating tasks to specialized servers.  
- **Interoperability:** Enables different LLM applications to share the same context sources and tools.  
- **Efficiency:** Simplifies development by providing a common interface for interacting with GitHub.


## **How Does the GitHub MCP Server Work?**

**Architecture:**

- **MCP Hosts:** Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP  
- **MCP Clients:** Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers  
- **MCP Servers:** Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol  
- **Local Data Sources:** Your computer's files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access  
- **Remote Services:** External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to

**Flow:**

1. **Client Request:** An LLM application sends a JSON-RPC request to the MCP server.  
2. **Server Processing:** The MCP server processes the request and interacts with the GitHub API.  
3. **Response:** The server sends a response back to the LLM application.

## **Steps to Run the GitHub MCP Server**

**1. Install Docker:**  
Ensure Docker is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the Docker website.

**2. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token:**

- Go to your GitHub account settings.  
- Navigate to *Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Fine-grained tokens.*  
- Select repo access (you can select any option), and in the permissions, make sure you give the necessary permissions for your use case (recommended: read-only access to Copilot Chat).  
- Hit “Create token,” copy the token, and store it securely (you won't be able to view it later).

**3. Create an empty folder and open it in VS Code.**

**4. Run the Server on Docker:**

Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -i --rm -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN` with your actual GitHub Personal Access Token.

**5. Adjust Settings in VS Code:**

Go to the GitHub MCP Server repo and click on **Install Server** for VS Code (not VS Code Insider—although you can use Insider, it's recommended to use VS Code).

![image2.png](all-images\image2.png)

A pop-up will appear (as shown in the image below).

![image3.png](all-images\image3.png)

Click **Open with Visual Studio Code**. You’ll be redirected to VS Code, and you'll see something like what's shown below.

![image4.png](all-images\image4.png)

First, install the required server to run the MCP server. Then, a code snippet will automatically be added to your `settings.json` like the one below.

![image5.png](all-images\image5.png)

At **line number 16**, add your GitHub token.  
After pasting the GitHub token, you’ll see a **Run** option in the code (just after line 4). Click on that to run the server.


### 6. Work with Copilot

Now, in VS Code:

- Open Copilot Chat (`CTRL + ALT + I`)  
- Install GitHub Copilot, if you haven’t done so.  
- Select Agent.

Optionally, select or deselect the tools you want to use. You can search for tools by typing in the search box.

## **How to use this GitHub MCP Server now?**
### Example Prompts

**Prompt:**  
_"How many repos are there in my GitHub profile?"_  
→ It fetched my profile using the GitHub access token and gave a response: I have 20 public repos—and that’s correct.

![image8.png](all-images\image8.png)

**Prompt:**  
_"Can you create a repo of Python tutorials from basics to OOPs concepts? I need `.ipynb` files written on each subtopic, where the `.ipynb` should have an introduction of the topic, definition, some theory parts, and a few practical examples for beginner understanding."_  

![image9.png](all-images\image9.png)

→ It created a repo named `python-tutorials`.

![image10.png](all-images\image10.png)

In the first response, the model asked if I had any specific subtopics or structure in mind. I answered that it should be for beginners.

![image11.png](all-images\image11.png)

Then it created `.ipynb` files and wrote very simple content (just an overview) for a few topics.

![image12.png](all-images\image12.png)

You can see the model also wrote a `README.md` file and created a few `.ipynb` files.  
Check the content here: [https://github.com/vinodkumargr/python-tutorials](https://github.com/vinodkumargr/python-tutorials)

It might not be perfect in terms of content, but look at how well it automated everything—just by writing prompts in Copilot, it created a repo, generated `.ipynb` files, and even wrote sample content.
